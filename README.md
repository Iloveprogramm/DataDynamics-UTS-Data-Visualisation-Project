# DataDynamics-UTS-Data-Visualisation-Project
32027 31080 Interactive Media - Spring 2022

## Background:
Within the research backdrop of the University of Technology Sydney, an avant-garde project was born, amassing a wealth of environmental data collected from sensors, ranging from rainfall, lighting, human traffic, wind speed, to solar radiation. These figures aren't just digits; they represent the voices and pulses of our environment, reflecting many facets of our daily life.

## Project Overview:
DataDynamicsUTS aims to transform this data into intuitive images and sounds through innovative visualization techniques. By merging a house model with real-time environmental data, we offer viewers an immersive experience, allowing them to see, hear, and even feel the implications of environmental changes.
