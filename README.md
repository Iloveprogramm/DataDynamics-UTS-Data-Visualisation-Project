# DataDynamics-UTS-Data-Visualisation-Project
32027 31080 Interactive Media - Spring 2022


## Background:
Within the research backdrop of the University of Technology Sydney, an avant-garde project was born, amassing a wealth of environmental data collected from sensors, ranging from rainfall, lighting, human traffic, wind speed, to solar radiation. These figures aren't just digits; they represent the voices and pulses of our environment, reflecting many facets of our daily life.

## Project Overview:
DataDynamicsUTS aims to transform this data into intuitive images and sounds through innovative visualization techniques. By merging a house model with real-time environmental data, we offer viewers an immersive experience, allowing them to see, hear, and even feel the implications of environmental changes.

## Professor's evaluation of the project (Dr. Ella Manor)
Overall, you have produced an excellent data visualisation tool that is effective and practical. The environment is represented using imaginary scenery, showing simple drawings of a building, rain, light bulbs, a sun, a windmill and people. I would have liked to see some details of the natural environment using simple text or a link to the location on a map. Your project makes it easy and intuitive to explore the weather station dataset by an inexperienced user. It provides sonification of the data and the raw values, including solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, charge current and number of people. It is easy to retrieve the people's counter data using the slider. The additional information (unit measures) is quite helpful in making sense of the data. The date/time text does not show correctly on a laptop display due to proportion issues. I like the addition of pleasant background music and rain sound. You have incorporated a simple interaction control over the date, but I would have liked to see more interaction control options. The visual and audio design is proficient as output components. Well done for excellent teamwork.
